# Gas and Smoke Detector Code

This repository contains the code for a gas and smoke detector implemented in C++. The code utilizes various sensors to detect the presence of gas and smoke in the surrounding environment and triggers appropriate actions based on the detected levels.

## Features

- Gas and smoke detection using sensor inputs
- Threshold-based detection for determining the severity of the gas or smoke presence
- Real-time monitoring and alerts
- Customizable actions based on the detection severity
- Easily extensible and modifiable codebase

## Requirements

- C++ compiler (supporting C++11 or later)
- Sensors compatible with the hardware setup (e.g., gas and smoke sensors)
- Additional hardware components as needed (e.g., microcontroller, wiring, etc.)

## Getting Started

To get started with the gas and smoke detector code, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/gas-and-smoke-detector.git
   ```

2. Connect the appropriate sensors and hardware components to your system, ensuring compatibility.

3. Navigate to the cloned repository's directory:

   ```
   cd gas-and-smoke-detector
   ```

4. Build the code using your preferred C++ compiler. For example, using g++:

   ```
   g++ -o gas_and_smoke_detector main.cpp
   ```

5. Execute the compiled program:

   ```
   ./gas_and_smoke_detector
   ```

6. The program will start monitoring the sensor inputs and provide real-time detection updates and actions.

## Configuration

The gas and smoke detector code can be customized by modifying the configuration variables within the code. These variables control aspects such as detection thresholds, actions, and sensor pin assignments.

```cpp
// Configuration Variables
const float GAS_THRESHOLD = 100.0;    // Gas detection threshold (modify as needed)
const float SMOKE_THRESHOLD = 200.0;  // Smoke detection threshold (modify as needed)
const int GAS_SENSOR_PIN = A0;        // Gas sensor analog input pin (modify as needed)
const int SMOKE_SENSOR_PIN = A1;      // Smoke sensor analog input pin (modify as needed)
// ...

// Actions
void handleGasDetection(float gasLevel) {
    // Perform actions based on gas detection severity
    // ...
}

void handleSmokeDetection(float smokeLevel) {
    // Perform actions based on smoke detection severity
    // ...
}
// ...
```

Modify the configuration variables according to your specific requirements. For example, you can adjust the detection thresholds to define different levels of gas or smoke severity, and define appropriate actions in the corresponding handler functions.
